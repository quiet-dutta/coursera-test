<h1>Hamburg University of Technology Notes</h1>
<p>Below are the notes I took during lectures in TUHH, as well as the example sheets. None of this is official.</p>

<p>Included as well are stripped-down versions (eg. definition-only; script-generated and doesn't necessarily make sense), example sheets, and the source code. The source code has to be compiled with header.tex, and is also available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Note that the lecture notes are not reliable indicators for what was lectured in my year, or what will be lectured in your year, as I tend to change, add and remove contents from the notes after the lectures occur.</p>
